TrainLink Enhancement Requirements
Below are detailed specifications for three key feature enhancements to implement in the TrainLink workout application. These requirements are written to provide clear implementation guidance without requiring further clarification.
1. Enhanced Upcoming Workout Management
Requirement:
Implement granular control for managing scheduled workouts, including individual deletion and rescheduling capabilities.
Technical Specifications:
A. Delete Functionality Enhancement
Replace the current single delete button with a more versatile delete icon/button
When clicked, display a modal with two clearly labeled options:
"Delete this workout only" - Removes only the selected instance
"Delete entire series" - Removes all recurring instances of this workout
B. Add Reschedule Functionality
Add a calendar/reschedule icon button next to each upcoming workout
When clicked, open a date/time picker modal with:
Date selection (calendar view)
Time selection (hour/minute picker)
"Reschedule" and "Cancel" buttons
After rescheduling, all subsequent workouts in the series must be adjusted to maintain the same pattern (e.g., if weekly, maintain the same day of week but with new times)
C. Implementation Details
Update the deleteScheduledWorkout() function to accept a parameter indicating whether to delete a single instance or the entire series
Create a new rescheduleWorkout(workoutId, oldDateTime, newDateTime, isRecurring) function
Store a reference to the "parent" workout for recurring workouts to maintain relationships
Update the localStorage data structure to support these new operations:
2. User Accounts & Workout Sharing System
Requirement:
Implement a secure user account system with workout schedule sharing capabilities.
Technical Specifications:
A. User Authentication System
Implement using Firebase Authentication (recommended for security and ease of implementation without database expertise)
Required user fields:
Email (for login)
Password (min 8 characters, require numbers and special characters)
Display name (for social features)
Optional profile picture
B. Data Storage
Use Firebase Firestore for secure cloud storage (no need to set up your own database)
Create the following collections:
users: Store user profile information
workouts: Store user-created workouts
schedules: Store workout schedules with sharing permissions
C. Workout Sharing
Add "Share" button to workout schedules
Implement sharing via:
Unique URL with read-only access
Email invitation (recipient must create account to view)
Export as calendar file (.ics format)
D. Privacy & Security Implementation
Implement proper authentication state management
Set up Firebase security rules to restrict data access:
E. Implementation Steps
Set up Firebase project (free tier is sufficient to start)
Add Firebase SDK to the project
Create login/signup UI components
Modify existing localStorage functions to sync with Firebase when user is logged in
Implement data migration from localStorage to Firebase when user creates account
Add sharing UI and functionality
3. Workout Progress Analytics & Visualization
Requirement:
Implement comprehensive workout analytics to help users track their fitness journey with visual representations of progress.
Technical Specifications:
A. Data Collection
Track additional metrics for each completed workout:
Perceived exertion rating (1-10 scale)
Notes field for user comments
Actual duration completed (vs. planned duration)
Optional: heart rate data if available
B. Analytics Dashboard
Create a new "Progress" section in the app with:
Weekly/monthly workout summary
Streak calendar (similar to GitHub contribution graph)
Workout type distribution chart (pie/donut chart)
Time spent per workout category
C. Visualization Components
Implement using Chart.js (lightweight) or D3.js (more powerful but complex)
Required charts:
Line chart for workout frequency over time
Bar chart for duration by workout type
Calendar heatmap for consistency
Progress towards custom goals
D. Goal Setting Feature
Allow users to set measurable goals:
Number of workouts per week/month
Total minutes of exercise per week
Specific workout type targets
Custom goals with target dates
E. Implementation Details
Create a new analytics.js file to handle data processing
Extend the workout logging functionality to capture additional metrics
Store analytics data in the following structure:
F. Local Storage Fallback
Implement analytics that work without requiring user accounts
Store data in localStorage with option to migrate to cloud when user creates account
Implementation Notes
Security Considerations:
Never store sensitive user data in localStorage
Use HTTPS for all API communications
Implement proper input validation for all user inputs
Use Firebase Authentication for secure user management without needing database expertise
Progressive Enhancement:
Implement features to work with localStorage first, then add cloud sync
Ensure core functionality works without requiring account creation
Add clear benefits for creating accounts to encourage signups
Performance Optimization:
Lazy load the analytics components
Implement proper pagination for workout history
Use efficient data structures to minimize storage requirements
Testing Requirements:
Test all features on mobile, tablet, and desktop views
Verify functionality works in offline mode with appropriate feedback
Ensure data integrity when syncing between devices
These specifications provide a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the requested features without requiring database expertise, as Firebase handles the complex security and storage aspects while providing a straightforward API for developers.
